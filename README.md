# What are the steps to reproduce?
1.  Clone this repo: https://github.com/wilgert/angular-cdk-drag-drop-protractor-issue
2.  git checkout 7.0.0-beta.2
3.  npm install
4.  ng serve
5.  ng e2e
6.  See that both e2e tests pass
7.  git checkout 7.0.0-beta.2
8.  npm install
9.  ng e2e
10. See that now the second test fails because the card is not dragged and dropped.
